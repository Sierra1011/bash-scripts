# bash-scripts

A repo for me to keep my half-baked bash scripts with which I vaguely maintain my binaries

To do:
 - [x] start getting the download URL instead of hardcoding it
 - [ ] add some sort of list to track what binaries have been done / have not been done
 - [ ] add input to choose a version
